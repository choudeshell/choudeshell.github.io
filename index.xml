      <description>Hello. I&amp;rsquo;m Chris Houdeshell. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit herder, a pointer wrecker, and HTTP is my best friend.
I spend my days creating bits that make the cloud fluffy. I love all modern technology but a special place is reserved in my heart for IoT, embedded devices, distributed systems and anything that has a content-type.
During the day, I conjure up software as an Assistant Vice President at EnergyCAP. Or I just have meetings about conjuring up software.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that the first Technical Preview of Azure Stack will be available Friday, January 29. Like many others, I&amp;rsquo;ve already provisioned a machine. The thought of true private-public hybrid cloud excites me. While information is currently limited, here are my thoughts before the release.
 Working for a small business, costs are always a concern. While the cloud enables us to provision outside of our data center and respond to change quickly, fluid costs limit the full potential of us using the cloud.</description>
