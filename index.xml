      <description>Hello. I&#39;m Chris Houdeshell. I&#39;m a bit herder, a pointer wrecker, and HTTP is my best friend. 0xA3 &amp;amp; 0x7C are also my friends, but not 0x08.
I spend my days creating bits that make the cloud fluffy. I love all modern technology but a special place is reserved in my heart for low-level, embedded devices, distributed systems and anything that has a content-type.
During the day, I conjure up software as CTO (either Chief Technology Officer or Chief Toddling Officer) at EnergyCAP.</description>

      <title>&#39;NAMESPACED&#39; CLAIMS IN KEYCLOAK</title>

      <description>Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management application that rivals top IAM SaaS products, including Auth0.
 Something that took me an inordinate amount of time was trying to add custom &amp;lsquo;namespaced&amp;rsquo; claims to the Keycloak&#39;s access_token.
Previously, I&#39;ve used Auth0 as an IAM; adding a custom claim with Auth0 only worked with &amp;lsquo;namespaced&amp;rsquo; claims &amp;mdash; claims that were prefixed with a URL. In Auth0&#39;s case, https://choudeshell.com/role_type was considered &amp;lsquo;namespaced&amp;rsquo; claim.</description>
